<strong>Gameplay:</strong><br>
To start the game click two tiles. They both will be flipped over revealing a hidden emoji. If the two flipped tiles do not match you will lose a point and the cards will flip back over. For every 3 points you lose you will lose a star.

To win the game simply match every card before your stars run out. You will get a win message showing you how many moves it took you along with how many stars you have left. If you lose all 3 stars you will get a lose message showing you how many moves it took you.
